# Photofy

Photofy is all about sharing moments from different locations around the world.

## Getting Started

The app uses React JS for the User Interface, reactstrap for responsiveness and modern look and Kinvey as database.

### Installing

To use Photofy, you need to install all dependencies by using the following command in the Terminal/Command Prompt:

```
npm install
```

In order to create an admin account, you'd have to get into your Kinvey database and change the field "isAdmin" of the user to "true". (lack of time...)
